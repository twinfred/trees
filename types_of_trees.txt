1. Full Binary Tree
-- Every node has either 0 or 2 children

2. Complete Binary Tree
-- All levels are completely filled (except possibly the last level)
-- Nodes in the last level are filled from left to right

3. Perfect Binary Tree
-- All internal nodes have 2 children
-- All leaves are at the same level
-- Number of nodes in tree can be calculated based on the height(h) -- Equation to find number of nodes = (2^h - 1)

4. Balanced Binary Tree
-- Height of this tree is O(log N) -- N being the number of Nodes
-- Height of Left Subtree - Height of Right Subtree <= 1 -- Equation: (MinHeight - MaxHeight) <= 1
-- The MinHeight is the height of the first node that doesn't have either a left and a right leaf
-- The MaxHeight is the height of the last node that doesn't have both a left and a right node

5. Degenerate / Pathological Tree
-- Every internal node has only one child
-- Performance-wise it's the same as a Linked List
